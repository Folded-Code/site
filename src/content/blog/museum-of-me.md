## Thesis

I think recording your life provides many benefits:

- Increase total enjoyment of individual experiences by remembering them (micro)
- The feeling of a _full life_ with _many experiences_ (macro)
- Share your way of life and lessons learned with others
- Leave a legacy for the few generations that will remember you

## What I'm doing?

### Journal

Since 2021-08-31 I have kept a daily journal not missing a single day. It contains the general events of the day and my feelings. I plan on keeping this up for the rest of my life

### This Site

This site is another part. I am trying to make it the single door into the house that is my life with many other rooms branching off. I want people to be able to come here and get a good idea about what makes me, me.

### Photos

I am not the best on this front but I am experimenting with taking more. I think you lose some important essence of a moment when you only represent it in text and that photos bridge that gap.

## Plans

One day I hope to create a documentary and or book about me. I want to be able to share the lesson's I've learned with others and show them a possible way of life. I have learned so much from the people who came before me and I want to help the next wave of people after me.

## I want to do the same, how do I start?

I am only really qualified to talk about journalling as of now.

### Journal

1. Choose a platform (Notion, Obsidian, day one, apple, etc)
2. Choose a format
3. Set a daily reminder

#### Platform

I used both Notion and Obsidian and I preferred Notion. It is stored free in the cloud, you can access it on mobile for free, and I use notion for the rest of my second brain.

If you're more of the _highly optimised i3 linux user_ type then Obsidian is probably better for you. There are lots of plugins.

If you use notion already I would recommend using it for your journal as well.

#### Format

The template I use is:

```md
## Accomplished

- [ ]
-

## What happened

-

## Feelings

-

## Questions

- What would have been different if you were your optimal self?

## Improvements

-

## Gratitude

-
```

Under Accomplished the check box is for my [daily highlight](https://maketime.blog/article/choose-a-highlight-to-make-time-every-day/) and the bullet points is for any other things completed.

What happened is a general summary of my day in a _this, that, and the other_ format.

I don't always fill out gratitude or improvements but I try to. You don't have to fill out everything every day. **_Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good_**.

Much like any other type of thoughts writing out your feelings help you understand them better as you are forced to convert them into concrete words instead of mushy brain thoughts. It has helped me understand the deeper reasons for my feelings.

#### Daily Reminder

Some people prefer to journal on an ad-hoc basis. I prefer every day and I think journalling every day compounds the benefits. If writing ever day is a challenge I think you should lower the scope of your journalling before you lower the frequency.
