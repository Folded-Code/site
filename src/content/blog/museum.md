## What is a Museum of Me?

I want to be able to be _downloadable_ from [this site](/). To me that means that someone can visit it, read some things, and get a good idea of who I am really.

I find with people who don't actively produce content online you don't really know who they are from their online presence.

## Benefits

- Inbound opportunities (jobs, friends, etc)
- Clearer thinking
- Saved memories to look back on

## Plans

One day I hope to create a documentary and or book about me. I want to be able to share the lesson's I've learned with others and show them a possible way of life. I have learned so much from the people who came before me and I want to help the next wave of people after me.

## What I'm doing?

- [Building this site](#building-this-site)
- [Journaling](#journaling)
<!-- - [Taking Photos](#taking-photos) -->

### Building this site

I am trying to make it the single door into the house that is my life with many other rooms branching off.

### Journaling

Since 2021-08-31 I have kept a daily journal only missing a couple days. It contains the general events of the day and my feelings. I plan on keeping this up for the rest of my life

<!-- ### Taking Photos -->

## Learnings

You may think your "normal" is not worth saving but as your normal changes remembering the previous normals is more revealing than the highlight reel.
