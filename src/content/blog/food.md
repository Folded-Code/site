## Philosophy

I have thought a lot about how I think about food and how it integrates with my life. I have found that I naturally optimise in the order:

1. Health
2. Time
3. Affordability
4. Taste

For me this means

- \>90% of my meals to be healthy
- I want to spend as little time between the initial _want_ and being able to _eat_
- Don't spend exorbitant amounts of money on food
- I don't want to resent eating because of the taste

## Huel

Huel has been a game changer me. Huel is a powdered food that you mix with water and drink. It is nutritionally complete (you can live off of it), and most importantly for me, it is very convenient.

Including bars I have on average 2.43 400 calorie huel based meals a day. Usually breakfast and lunch.

## Dinner

I don't care too much about eating with people. If I am in a season of work I prefer to use dinner to relax. This usually means alone with some content.
