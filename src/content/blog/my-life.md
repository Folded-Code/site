## Early life

Born in Montgomery country Maryland in 2005 and raised in a single family house in suburbia Silver Spring. My dad was an Economic teacher at [CUA](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html) and my Mom ran her [own business](http://www.braidforbes.com/) doing healthcare analysis. My Dad taught me maths from a young age and I got good at it.

In my early "education" I had trouble reading but was great at maths being multiple years ahead. In 3rd grade I was diagnosed with Dyslexia and it all made sense. In 4th grade I went to the [Siena school](https://www.thesienaschool.org/), a school specifically for dyslexic kids.

I was there until 8th grade and it was great for me. I started to excel in school and was allowed to do maths 3 years ahead. However since it was a small school I didn't have any intellectual competition and I stagnated.

## Ireland

My grandmother left Ireland at 19 to come to America to start a life. Fortunately that gives me the claim to Irish citizenship. After 8th grade I moved to Ireland with my Mom and Dad.

I didn't find moving emotionally difficult at all. I don't understand people that do. I found the two countries very similar and made friends at my new school.

I joined 2nd year and for the next 2 years until the start of 4th year (transition year) I didn't do anything too cool. I continued to be ahead in maths.

# Exponential Growth

In 4th year things changed. I entered a project in the BT Young Scientist competition (Ireland's nation science competition) with my two best friends [Will](https://willcarkner.com/) and [Vedh](https://vedhkannan.com/) creating a new design for crutches. We won 1st place for our category, technology intermediate.

We were invited to the BT Young Scientist Business bootcamp and got an email about a summer youth accelerator program called [Patch](https://www.joinpatch.org/). We applied and were somehow accepted.

## Patch

This program would completely change the trajectory of my life. Over the February midterm break I started reading self improvement books and started watching Y Combinator videos. I was hooked on entrepreneurship.

The program was very good. I learned how to work hard and fell in love with in.

I worked in a team of 4 on an AI multiple question generator that would make leveraging active recall and spaced repetition (like anki) easy by automatically generating the questions for you. I mostly worked on building out the web app. I left the project after the end of the project.

## 5th Year

Didn't spend my time the best but learned that lesson, got much better at web development, got bronze at the [all irish programming olympiad](http://aipo.ucc.ie/), got a gold medal the [Young Economist competition](https://www.youngeconomist.ie/), and more to happen.

Currently in 5th year
