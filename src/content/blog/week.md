## Philosophy

I think the results of a person is a lagging measure of how they spend their time

My current lens for thinking about time is trying to maximise total productive output. This means I think about rest as a means to be more productive later or hanging out with friends as a means to get motivations or new perspectives.

### Notes

- Gym opens late on weekends. I would grind earlier.
- Sometime I stay up later watching something with my family

## Sunday

- Pretty variable
- I try to recover and prepare my body / mind for the week ahead.
- I try to go for a long multi-hour and listen to podcasts or audiobooks at 3x speed.
