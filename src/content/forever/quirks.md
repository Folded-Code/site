## Social

- Introvert (people make me lose energy)
- Social anxiety
  - very stupid when I'm nervous (even small amounts of pressure)
    - to unlock the _not stupid me_, communicate asynchronously
  - will make irrational decisions to avoid potential social _awkwardness_
- I don't want gifts and I don't want to give gifts

## Personal

- Dyslexic
  - audio > text (I listen at 3x speed. not as hard as you think)
  - enhanced visual thinking
- Very particular about:
  - Schedule
  - Food timings (when I'm in a season of work I want 100% control)

## Random

- I drink a lot of water (a lot)
- I really don't like paper documents. I much prefer digital
- I don't eat movie food while the movie is paused or before it starts
