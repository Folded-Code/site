## Philosophy

> The results of a person is a lagging measure of how they spend their time

\- Me (and probably many before me)

My current lens for thinking about time is trying to maximise total productive output. This means I think about rest as a means to be more productive later or hanging out with friends as a means to get motivations or new perspectives.

### Notes

<!-- - I do a good deal of shallow work at school.
- I have Maths, Applied Maths, and Irish as basically free periods.
- I have 1hr of break including lunch during school. -->

### Notes

- DPL only opens at 9:00. I would grind earlier.
- Gym opens late on weekends so I don't go.
- Sometime I stay up later watching something with my family or hanging out with friends.

## Sunday

- Pretty variable
- I try to recover and prepare my body / mind for the week ahead.
- I try to go for a long multi-hour and listen to podcasts or audiobooks at 3x speed.
  - Once walked 30.69 km (actual number) from Malahide to Dun Laoghaire.
